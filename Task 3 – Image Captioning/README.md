# Task 3 – Image Captioning

This project extracts visual features from an image using a pre-trained CNN (InceptionV3), which will later be used to generate text captions using a language model.

## ✅ Completed (Part 1):
- Image loading and preprocessing
- Feature extraction from image

## 🚧 Next:
- Build LSTM-based decoder to generate captions
- Use dataset like Flickr8k or use dummy caption for now
