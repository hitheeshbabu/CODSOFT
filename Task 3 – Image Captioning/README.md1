## ðŸ§  Caption Generation (Part 2)

For simplicity, we simulate a small LSTM model and show how a sequence of tokens can represent a caption. In a full project, this would involve training on a large dataset like Flickr8k with many image-caption pairs.

- A dummy vocabulary is used
- An LSTM-based model is created
- The caption is generated using hardcoded dummy input
